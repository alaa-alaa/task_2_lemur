I own a clothes store that specializes in selling things for kids in a city mall. My friend, who is a programmer, created a website for me a while back using HTML and JavaScript to promote my products online. I recently uploaded additional newborn-related things to my city store. Newborn Baby Sleeping Tools is the name of this primary item. White noise machines, blankets, and cribs are some of its sub-items. This main item and its components are what I want to add to my website to modernize it and turn it into an online store where customers may make purchases. Add a "cart" function that lets users put things in a cart. 
In the navigation bar, display a little shopping cart icon that changes in real time based on the quantity of new goods added.
Give customers the option to view their selected goods, quantities, and total price in a checkout or summary screen. Permit users to click on a heart icon on each card to "favorite" items. To ensure that the user's favorite items remain accessible even after a page refresh, store them in local storage. The website should have a responsive design that works on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
